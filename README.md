## DeLUT Usage

You can use the DeLUT file to get a corrected image for post-processing. It fixes most of contrast issues, while also correcting for most color shifts from the camera.

There are two versions available:

- **Neutral:** Pretty much a clean image without any grading applied to it. Great for post-processing work.

- **Standard:** Applies some basic color grading to the image, works better for batching a lot of images without time for grading.
